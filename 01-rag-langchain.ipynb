Additionally, I have worked on integrating revenue management systems \\nsuch as IDeaS, Duetto, and Revenue Analytics, as well as optimizing ETL (Extract, \\nTransform, Load) processes to improve data handling eIiciency.

While AI and \\nautomation can optimize processes and drive eIiciency, they should also be designed \\nwith ethical considerations, ensuring that advancements do not contribute to inequality \\nor biases. Cultural values play a signiﬁcant role in shaping how technology is perceived \\nand implemented across diIerent societies. For example, in data privacy-sensitive \\nregions, technologies should prioritize security and transparency, whereas in developing \\nnations, innovation should focus on bridging digital divides and making technology more \\naccessible. This balance between technological advancement and cultural adaptability \\nis something I strongly advocate for, both in my work and research. \\nAs I navigate my master’s program in Data Science and AI, my research interests continue \\nto evolve.
